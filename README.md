# Bachelor-Thesis-2020
This is my bachelor's thesis, which was written in Python. It used the OpenCV library to search for objects of a certain color. Eventually in my program you can select any color and after that the camera will track only that color. This is a very fun application, I suggest you test it by running the file OpenCV_final.py.
