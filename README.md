# Bachelor-Thesis-2020
This is my bachelor's thesis, which was written in Python. It used the OpenCV library to search for objects of a certain color. Eventually in my program you can select any color and after that the camera will track only that color. 

This is a very fun application, I suggest you test it by running the file OpenCV_final.py. The webcam must be turned on and the program must have access to it.

In addition there are other files in the project, which also relate to the tracking of objects. For example, the file OpenCV_img includes the ability to track people's faces via the webcam. The found face is highlighted by a blue square frame.

To close any of the programs, just press CTRL + C in the console, which will interrupt program execution.

I would also like to add that I also created a similar application for tracking faces in C++ using TensorFlow. But it is not as well implemented as Python, so I am uploading only Python version to Github. But keep in mind that it is also possible to track faces and objects with TensorFlow in C++. There are many other projects by other people that have implemented this well on C++.

Have fun!
